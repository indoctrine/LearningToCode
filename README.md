# LearningToCode
Hello! You've either found or been given a link to my LearningToCode repository.
I have been attempting to learn to code properly since I was about 10 years old. I am currently utilising Peter Grossman's Discrete Mathematics for Computing and Learning PHP, MySQL & JavaScript with JQuery, CSS & HTML5 by Robin Nixon (O'Reilly) books. The maths book provides me with the exercises uploaded here and the PHP book teaches me the tools with which to build them.

When I code, I tend to experiment and make the code more compact until I break it. I've started this repository as a way to keep track of all those little updates I make.

I am learning:
- PHP
- JavaScript
- MySQL
- Updating my knowledge of HTML5
