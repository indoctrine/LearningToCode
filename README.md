# LearningToCode
Hello! You've either found or been given a link to my LearningToCode repository.
I have been attempting to learn to code properly since I was about 10 years old. My latest attempt utilises Peter Grossman's Discrete Mathematics for Computing and PHP and MySQL Web Development by Marty Matthews books. The maths books provides me with the exercises uploaded here and the PHP book teaches me the tools to build them.

When I code, I tend to experiment and make the code more compact until I break it. I've started this repository as a way to keep track of all those little updates I make.

I am learning:
- PHP
- JavaScript
- MySQL
- Updating my knowledge of HTML5
